- `name` (String) The human-readable name of the cluster.
- `plan` (Attributes) Plan holds some information about the cluster's current subscription plan. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--plan))
- `release` (Attributes) Release holds some information about the cluster's current release. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--release))
- `space` (Attributes) Space holds some information about where the cluster is running. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--space))
- `state` (Attributes) State represents the current state of the cluster. This indicates what the cluster is doing at any given moment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--state))
- `stats` (Attributes) Stats holds *some* statistics about the cluster.
