# Bonsai Provider

The Bonsai provider is used to create and manage resources on the Bonsai.io platform.
To use the provider, you must provide both an API Access Key and Token, obtainable from within the [Bonsai.io](https://bonsai.io) management panel!

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Bonsai Provider using the required_providers stanza.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    bonsai = {
      source  = "omc/bonsai"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "bonsai" {
  # Optionally omit this entry to get the value from the BONSAI_API_KEY
  # environment variable.
  api_key = var.bonsai_api_key

  # Optionally omit this entry to get the value from the BONSAI_API_TOKEN
  # environment variable.
  api_token = var.bonsai_api_token
}
